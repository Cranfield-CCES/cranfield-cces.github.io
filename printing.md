# Printing

The site describing the printing process and the guides for setting up your
printer can be found [here](https://intranet.cranfield.ac.uk/it/Pages/Printing.aspx).
Follow the instruction from the "Printing from non-University devices" guide.
As a research student the printing service is free to use.


Note: for Linux you might need to install extra packages. For Ubuntu 19.10 I
needed to use `apt install` to get the `python3-smbc` and `smbclient` packages.
The printer settings might need to be changed to hold.
